                    In 2016, pharmacologist Susan Howlett wrote up a study on how hormone levels during pregnancy affect heart function and sent it off to a journal.

                    When the reviewers' comments came back, two of the three had asked an unexpected question: where were the tissues from male mice?

                   Because they were studying high hormone levels related to pregnancy, Howlett, at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, and her team had used only female animals. “I was really surprised that they wanted us to repeat everything in males,” she said.

                   Howlett had mixed feelings about the request to add males. “It was a big ask and it was a lot more research.” But in general, she adds, it's really important to factor sex into studies. “I'm a big proponent of doing experiments in both males and females.”
